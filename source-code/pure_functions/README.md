# Pure functions

The GNU C++ compiler defines an annotation for functions to
mark them as "pure", i.e., side-effect free.

Note that this is a GNU specific extension.


## What is is?

1. `functions.cpp`: function implementtion.
1. `functions.h`: function definition.
1. `pure_functions.cpp`: main function to do the timing.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.
