# Source code

This is source code that is either used in the presentation, or was developed
to create it.  There is some material not covered in the presentation as well.

## What is it?

1. `branching`: branching instructions can decrease performance.
1. `fdo`: small illustration of using FDO (Feedback Directed Optimization).
1. `gallery-processor-cacheEffects`: C implementations of the code examples
    given in Igor Ostrovsky's interesting blog post on effects the various
    caching mechanisms in a modern CPU can have on performance.  See the
    following URL for his original post:

1. `pure_functions`: performance impact of the pure annotation.
1. `compiler_options`: testing the influcence of compiler options on performance.
